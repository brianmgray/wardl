        You get {Constants.MAX_GUESSES} tries to guess a target word.
      </p>
      <p>
        Each guess must be a valid five-letter word. After each guess, the tiles 
        will show you how close your guess was to the target.

      <h2>Wardl</h2>
      <p>
        In <strong>Wardl</strong>, the target word changes by one letter on every incorrect guess. Each
        change always results in a valid 5 letter word. Let's look at an example game.
      </p>
      <table
        className="Game-rows"
        aria-label="Wardl example guesses">

        />
        <Row
          rowState={RowState.LockedIn}
          wordLength={5}
          cluedLetters={[
            { clue: Clue.Correct, letter: "w" },
            { clue: Clue.Correct, letter: "h" },

          target={'whale'}
        />
        </tbody>
      </table>
      <p>
        NOTE: You don't see the targets until the game ends. 
      </p>
      <p>
        The clues always relate to the current target. For example, when the target changed from 
        "shale" to "whale", the <b className={"green-bg"}>S</b> became an <b>S</b> because "S" was 
        no longer in the correct place.
